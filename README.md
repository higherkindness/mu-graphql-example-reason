# mu-graphql-example-reason ðŸš€

To run this example, you need to run the [Mu-Haskell](https://github.com/higherkindness/mu-haskell) GraphQL server example (with [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install)):

```sh
$ stack run library-graphql
```

... on another terminal...

```sh
$ npm run server # this opens up a server on http://localhost:3000
```

...and, finally, on a third terminal!


```sh
$ npm start # this gets reason code compiled to js...
```
